      <h2>🎹 Fanny Mendelssohn — The Piano Behind the Curtain</h2>

      <p><strong>It was 1830 in Berlin.</strong><br>
      Fanny Mendelssohn, older sister of the famous Felix Mendelssohn, was a brilliant pianist and composer.
      From the moment she could reach the keys, her fingers danced across the piano, producing melodies that made even professional musicians stop and stare.</p>

      <p>But Fanny faced a cruel reality: society expected women to remain in the shadows.
      Publishing music under her own name was almost impossible. Her compositions were often credited to her brother, though she had written them herself.</p>

      <p>Despite this, Fanny did not let injustice stop her. She held salons in her home, inviting the greatest musicians of Berlin.
      There, she performed her compositions, shared ideas, and experimented freely — even if the wider world wouldn’t acknowledge her genius yet.</p>

      <p>One evening, she premiered a new piece for her closest friends. It was soft, lyrical, and deeply expressive. The audience was captivated. A critic later wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>“There is a voice here, delicate yet undeniable. The keys speak truths words cannot touch.”</blockquote>

      <p>Fanny’s story is a reminder: talent is not enough — resilience and creativity matter more.
      She transformed limitations into opportunity, and her music survived to inspire generations.</p>

      <h3>🎵 Hidden Lesson</h3>
      <p>Intermediate pianists often struggle with comparison and self-doubt: “I’m not as good as…”, “I can’t perform publicly yet…”
      Fanny teaches us:</p>

      <blockquote>“Your music matters, even if the world doesn’t notice immediately.
      Play with passion, even in private. Let your piano be your voice before it’s anyone else’s.”</blockquote>

      <h3>🎹 Practical Exercise</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Compose a 2-bar melody inspired by your day.</li>
        <li>Play it repeatedly, experimenting with:
          <ul>
            <li>Different dynamics (soft/loud)</li>
            <li>Different tempos (slow/fast)</li>
            <li>Expressive phrasing (what feels happy? Sad? Excited?)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Optional: record it and listen back. Don’t worry about mistakes — the point is expression and creativity.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Even small compositions like this train your musical imagination and touch sensitivity, key traits of advanced pianists.</p>
