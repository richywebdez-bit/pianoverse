      <h2>The Night Chopin Challenged the Storm</h2>

      <p><strong>The year was 1838.</strong><br>
      The streets of Majorca, Spain, were being ripped apart by a violent storm. Trees bent, windows shattered, and thunder rolled like the rage of an unseen god. Inside a cold monastery, a frail young man sat by candlelight, his chest heavy with sickness. That man was <strong>Frédéric Chopin</strong>.</p>

      <p>He had fled Paris with his lover George Sand in search of peace and better health. Instead, the storm outside echoed the chaos inside his lungs. His coughing was relentless, his hands trembling. But what do you do when your only language is music? You speak back — through the piano.</p>

      <p>The piano they found in the monastery was terribly out of tune, its keys stiff with damp air. But that didn’t stop Chopin. As lightning flashed through the tall windows, he pressed his fingers into the keyboard and began to play — the <em>Prelude in D-flat Major</em>, later called <strong>“Raindrop Prelude.”</strong></p>

      <p>Each drop outside became a note in his mind. He transformed fear into sound. The relentless storm became rhythm. His trembling hands became thunder. He didn’t fight the storm — he joined it.</p>

      <p>When George Sand later found him, he was pale and soaked with sweat. He whispered:</p>

      <blockquote>“I thought I was dead… but the piano kept me alive.”</blockquote>

      <p>That night, the <em>“Raindrop Prelude”</em> was born — one of the most emotional piano works ever written.</p>

      <h3>🎵 Hidden Lesson</h3>
      <p>Every intermediate pianist reaches a point where practice feels like a storm — nothing sounds right, and progress feels invisible. Chopin teaches us one thing:</p>

      <blockquote><strong>Don’t fight the storm. Turn emotion into motion.</strong></blockquote>

      <p>Play through frustration, sadness, or fatigue — that’s when your soul starts playing, not your hands.</p>

      <h3>🎹 Practical Exercise</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Sit at your piano and play a simple chord progression: <strong>C → Am → F → G.</strong></li>
        <li>Now, slow it down and imagine each chord as a mood:</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>C = Calm</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Am = Sadness</strong></li>
        <li><strong>F = Hope</strong></li>
        <li><strong>G = Strength</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <ol start="3">
        <li>Use dynamics — make it thunder softly and then fade to rain.</li>
        <li>Try to “paint” your mood using the keys.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Repeat this for 10 minutes. You’re not just practicing — you’re creating your own prelude.</p>

      <h3>💡 Piano Fact</h3>
      <p>Chopin never played loudly in public. His strength was whispering emotion through the keys — something only pianists with true control can do. <br>
      Liszt called him <em>“the poet of the piano.”</em></p>
