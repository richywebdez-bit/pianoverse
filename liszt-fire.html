      <h2>🔥 Liszt and the Fire in His Hands</h2>

      <p><strong>It was 1841 in Berlin.</strong><br>
      The concert hall overflowed with people — women in silk gowns, men in black coats, all pushing to get a glimpse of a tall, striking man with wild hair. His name? <strong>Franz Liszt.</strong></p>

      <p>When Liszt stepped on stage, he didn’t walk — he glided, as if possessed by some invisible rhythm. His eyes glimmered, his coat shimmered under the chandeliers, and when he sat at the piano, silence fell so deep it felt holy.</p>

      <p><strong>Then — BOOM!</strong><br>
      His hands exploded across the keys like fireworks. The room gasped. Liszt played with such fire and speed that the audience could barely believe it was humanly possible. His hands blurred. His wrists danced. His head swayed. Some women reportedly fainted; others tore pieces of his gloves or locks of his hair after the concert. The newspapers called it <em>“Lisztomania.”</em></p>

      <p>But behind all that glamour was something few knew — Liszt practiced like a demon.</p>

      <blockquote>“If I don’t practice for one day, I notice it.<br>
      If I don’t practice for two, my friends notice.<br>
      If I don’t practice for three, the audience notices.”</blockquote>

      <p>To Liszt, technique was not vanity — it was freedom. He believed you should never be limited by your fingers when your heart wants to express something big.</p>

      <h3>🎵 Hidden Lesson</h3>
      <p>True power at the piano doesn’t come from talent — it comes from discipline turned into art.
      Liszt wasn’t born a god at the keyboard. He built himself through repetition, focus, and curiosity.
      He turned practice into performance.</p>

      <p><strong>So the real challenge is this:</strong><br>
      How can you make your daily practice feel like a concert — full of purpose, story, and energy?</p>

      <h3>🎹 Practical Exercise</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose a technical passage or scale you already know (C major, D minor, etc).</li>
        <li>Play it softly, then loudly, then very fast, then very slow.</li>
        <li>Notice the difference — this builds dynamic control and speed balance.</li>
        <li>Next, take one bar from a favorite piece and play it with drama — move your body, exaggerate your touch, imagine you’re performing to thousands.</li>
      </ol>

      <blockquote>Do 15 minutes of this daily, and your fingers will soon move like lightning — but with meaning behind every note.</blockquote>

      <h3>💡 Piano Fact</h3>
      <p>Liszt was the first pianist to perform entire concerts from memory.
      Before him, musicians always read sheet music on stage.
      He changed performance forever — proving that music should be lived, not just read.</p>
